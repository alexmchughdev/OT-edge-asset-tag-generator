# OT Edge Device Asset Tag Generator

A lightweight, standalone Go tool for generating unique identifiers and QR codes for OT edge device asset management.

## Key Features

* **Asset Tagging**: Generates custom `dfx-` prefixed UUIDs specifically for tracking OT hardware and edge devices.
* **On-the-Fly QR Encoding**: Renders high-quality QR codes as Base64 PNGs on the fly—no external APIs or data leaks.
* **Exclusive Copy Logic**: Refined UI behavior—clicking a new ID instantly clears the highlight and checkmark of any previous ones to avoid confusion.
* **Manual Overrides**: Tap the pencil icon to manually edit a tag. It validates against the expected UUID format and refreshes the QR code automatically.
* **Interface**: Modern, mobile-responsive design with a dedicated Dark Mode.
* **Local History**: Keeps the last 5 tags synced in the browser so you can verify recent deployments even after a refresh.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Go (using `net/http` and `skip2/go-qrcode`).
* **Frontend**: Vanilla JS and CSS3. Zero frameworks.
* **Infrastructure**: Rocky Linux + systemd.
* **Access**: Cloudflare Tunnel for secure, encrypted traffic to the edge without opening inbound firewall ports.

## Networking (Cloudflare)

The app is served via **https://getdfx.uk**.

Using a Cloudflare Tunnel ensures a "Secure Context," which is required for the browser to allow the Copy to Clipboard feature to work natively.
